My first place to store code
I have a cat named Juno. She's a sweet, spunky Siamese cat who loves to chew on plastic bags and loves hanging out at parties.
I am learning blockchain coding to see where that can take me in a new industry.
Thanks to anyone who reads my code, and may be able to give suggestions.
